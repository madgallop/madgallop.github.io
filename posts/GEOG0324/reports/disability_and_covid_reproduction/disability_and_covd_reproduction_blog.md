## Step one: identify
- identify an error, uncertain decision, or opportunity for improving reproducibility or study design
- write an plan for modifications in markdown, including
    - title and author (yourself)
    - description of modification(s) with rationale(s)
    - plan for visualizing/comparing/interpreting of results



## Step two: write
- modify the analysis plan to address the issue identified above

## Step three: implement
- implement the change in code

## Step four: interpret
- interpret the results of your change(s) in the rmarkdown report

## Step five: write
- write a blog post highlighting what you have learned from and contributed to with this reproduction and reanalysis study. In particular, please address these questions:
    - Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
    - If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
    - Are there opportunities to further improve the studyâ€™s research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
    - Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
