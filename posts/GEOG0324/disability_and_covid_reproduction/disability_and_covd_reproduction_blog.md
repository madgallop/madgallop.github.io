STEP ONE: 
identify an error, uncertain decision, or opportunity for improving reproducibility or study design
write an plan for modifications in markdown, including
title and author (yourself)
description of modification(s) with rationale(s)
plan for visualizing/comparing/interpreting of results
modify the analysis plan to address the issue identified above
implement the change in code
interpret the results of your change(s) in the rmarkdown report
knit a new study report in pdf and html forms
enable GitHub Pages on the repository to serve the html version of the report to the web
write a blog post highlighting what you have learned from and contributed to with this reproduction and reanalysis study. In particular, please address these questions:
Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
Are there opportunities to further improve the studyâ€™s research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
